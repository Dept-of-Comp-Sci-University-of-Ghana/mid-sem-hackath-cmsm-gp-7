## **Sentiment Analysis of LGBTQ Tweets**
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis of LGBTQ Tweets project :)! This repository contains the code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on a dataset comprising tweets related to the LGBTQ community. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in these tweets, we aim to gain valuable insights into public opinion, attitudes, and emotions surrounding LGBTQ issues.
### Project Overview
In this project, we collaborated as a team to tackle the challenging task of sentiment analysis on social media data. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the emotional tone and polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given text. By applying this technique to a dataset specifically focused on LGBTQ-related tweets, we aimed to uncover the sentiment and prevailing emotions within the broader LGBTQ community.
### Methodology
To perform sentiment analysis on the LGBTQ tweet dataset, we adopted a machine learning approach. Our methodology involved several key steps, including data preprocessing, lemmatization, cleaning the data, and sentiment classification, among others. We utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques and popular machine learning algorithms to build an accurate sentiment classifier.

  fyi: if you want to run this, kindly open this in google colab and change the path to the csv file :)
  you can also run this locally
